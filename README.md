# Drowsiness-Detection

## About
This project implements a driver drowsiness detection system using deep learning techniques. The system monitors the driver's eye state in real time and alerts the driver when signs of drowsiness are detected to enhance road safety.

## Features
- Real-time detection of driver drowsiness
- Uses convolutional neural networks (CNN) for eye state classification
- Visual and/or audio alert system for drowsiness detection
- Supports various video input formats for detection

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- OpenCV for image/video processing
- HTML, CSS for any front-end interface (if applicable)
- JavaScript (minor usage)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
2. Navigate to the project directory:
3. Install the required dependencies:
Make sure you have `tensorflow`, `opencv-python`, and other necessary libraries installed.

## Usage
Run the main Python script to start the drowsiness detection system:
Modify the script or input source as needed.
